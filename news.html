      <CENTER><H1>Epic sued Apple last week in a rapidly escalating fight over mobile app store policies. Apple banned Fortnite after Epic introduced direct payments that bypassed Apple’s in-app purchase system and its 30 percent commission. Epic retaliated with a lawsuit claiming that Apple violates antitrust law by controlling iOS platform access through the App Store and requiring developers to use its payment options.Apple’s response also contains a trove of emails between Sweeney, Schiller, and other Apple executives, including the on in which Sweeney asks for Apple to extend Epic’s requested changes to all developers. On June 30, Sweeney requested that Apple allow Epic to launch its own app store on iOS and include an alternative payment system in Fortnite and other Epic games that would allow those titles to bypass the App Store’s standard 30 percent cut.“Apple’s contracts and standards documents contain restrictive provisions that prohibit Epic from offering a competing app store and competing payment processing options to consumer,” Sweeney wrote. “Apple would need to provide a side letter or alter its contracts and standards documents to remove such restrictions.”
